# Exante Interview – Dylan Hughes

## How to Run

```bash
cd exante-solar

npm install

npm run dev

```

## Assumptions Made
irradiation.json and policies.json are mocked API responses placed in the public/ directory.

The project dynamically fetches and processes these files to calculate actual vs expected solar irradiation.

A responsive ECharts gauge is rendered to visually indicate whether the irradiation is on track, ahead, or below expectations.

## Thanks!
