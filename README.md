# Exante Interview - Dylan Hughes

## How to run
``
cd exante-solar

npm install

npm run dev
``

### Assumptions Made
This project was made under the assumption that the `irradiation.json` and `policies.json`are mocked responses from an endpoint.
The project contains logic to render a chart with 3 main labels, showing if the actual irradiation is above or below the expected amount.

### Thanks!
